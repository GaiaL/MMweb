Game Jam
----
CSUEB GAME JAMS are a series of three events set to occur in the middle of each quarter of the 2016/17 academic year.  Following a series of weekly tutorials by senior students and industry professionals each game jam is a separate culminating event which takes place over a weekend. Each GAME JAM opens on friday afternoon with a mixer event, a keynote which outlines and unveils the common theme for the particular event, a idea pitching session, that is followed by team formation.  On Saturday and Sunday, teams arrive in the morning for a small breakfast and peptalk and begin to work on their ideas.  Throughout the day, industry and professional participants circulate among the teams and offer mentoring and advice. On Sunday at 3:00PM it is pencils down and teams prepare to present their projects to the public.  The event concludes with presentations of the projects and a celebration of accomplishments.  The GAME JAM is a non-competitive event focussed on ideation and innovation and creating prototypes, rather than on product oriented success.

Since 2014, 250 students from 6 departments and three colleges at CSUEB as well assister CSU universities have participated in Game Jam

The structure of this event is to involve students in all phases of the event.  Students are involved in the planning, preparation and execution of the event and the actual participants of the event.  Students will network with industry professionals and work in cross functional teams and across disciplines and majors.  We live in a time when multidisciplinary ideation in the cornerstone to success in emerging technologies.  Employers across the spectrum stress the importance for new graduates to have highly collaborative skills and ability to work in teams. The project will expose all students to a multidisciplinary approach of ideation and execution.  STEM disciplines alongside of art will combine for an integrated STEAM event. Not only do students develop skills in teamwork during the event, but also in the weeks leading up to the event.
